                           <br> Phase 2 of this project will be all about choosing and putting those potential applications on track but for now, go explore our <a href="https://aliceingovernment.com/voters" target="_blank">voters section</a> to read about how other people think we should react to climate change, invite people that would enjoy sharing their opinion, and follow our updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/AliceinGov" target="_blank">Twitter.</a></p>

                    <p>Alice in Government would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following: </p>
                    <p>The right to access - You have the right to request Alice in Government for copies of your personal data. We may charge you a small fee for this service. </p>
                    <p>The right to rectification - You have the right to request that Alice in Government correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request Alice in Government to complete information you believe is incomplete. </p>
                    <p>The right to erasure - You have the right to request that Alice in Government erase your personal data, under certain conditions. </p>
                    <p>In accordance to Article 17 of GDPR section 3.d, the right to erasure will be limited to the extent that processing is necessary for “archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing”.</p>
                    <p>Since removing voters from our voters list would undermine our historical, scientific, and statistical research purposes, we will be not be able to erase your name, last name, vote selection, and nationality from our voters list. Other voters, users, and non-users of our platform might have a public interest in this voting process being permanent and immutable and thus removing voters might undermine the public interest and trust in this process.  </p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, we are happy to erase other details from your vote like your opinion on public topics, the short description of yourself, and so on.

Please send us an email to hello@aliceingovernment.com and we will send you the corresponding form. Without legitimate reasons, identity papers, or the erasure form filled, we will not be able to help you.</p>
                    <p>If for some reason an underage person uses our services in violation of our Terms of Service or by accident, we will cancel our restrictions on data erasure and completely erase all data he or she entered in our site.   </p>
                    <p>The right to restrict processing - You have the right to request that Alice in Government restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions. </p>
                    <p>The right to object to processing - You have the right to object to Alice in Government's processing of your personal data, under certain conditions. </p>
