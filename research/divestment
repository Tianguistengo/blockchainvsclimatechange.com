Endowments are made up of thousands of different investment accounts,
many of which can be restricted. That means the donor specified what the money could be used for. 
Sometimes it's scholarships. Sometimes it's the library, or maybe it's the football team.

Here's an example: A donor gives money to an endowment to fund scholarships for 100 low-income students.
The fund's manager is obligated to invest that money in a way that it can fund 100 scholarships this year, 
and each year going forward.

If the donor wanted it to be a one-time gift to build a new student union building, 
they would do just that -- make a one-time gift rather than donating to the endowment. 

--Harvard' endowment is the universitiy's largest financial asset 
and is made of more that 13k funds.

"Each of Harvard’s twelve Schools “owns” its share of the endowment. 
Roughly 80 percent of the funds that make up the endowment are dedicated by the donor to 
a specific School. School revenue profiles vary widely, and each draws a different 
proportion of its budget from its endowment.

Contributions may be given in support of a specific School, 
program, or activity, and can only be used for those purposes."

"Nonetheless, the UC system’s divestment announcement is a huge win for climate activists and adds to the pressure 
on other universities that are still holding on to their investments in coal, oil, and natural gas.

    You know who's not enjoying that news? The presidents of Harvard, Yale, Stanford, UMich, and the many many
    many other schools that have refused to divest. If the biggest system in the country has decided 
    it must sell its oil stock, the pressure on these guys will go way up

Schools like Harvard and Yale that have declined to divest their multibillion-dollar endowments
from fossil fuels have argued that divestment adds an unnecessary political element to their portfolios.
Investment managers have also argued that they have a better chance at shaping a company’s behavior as an investor,
and that fossil fuels will continue to be burned for years, regardless of any divestment activity.

Activists counter that declining to divest is a political action. They also say that as lucrative as fossil fuels remain,
it’s still unethical to profit from them, logic that universities invoked when they divested from tobacco companies.
